### Schedule

See the [official schedule](./schedule.csv) here on GitHub for the course schedule.
For more details on what we're going to cover each week, see the [seminar notes](../seminars).

### Required Technology

There's a couple of things that you'll need to participate in this class:

* a laptop or desktop with the ability to run Zoom (more on that below)
* a microphone to participate in class discussions
* the ability to share your screen on Zoom to present material

You do not need a webcam for this course.
I don't even have a webcam, and good ones have become ridiculously expensive due to the rise in people working from home.
You do, however, need the ability to share your screen so that you can present off of it.
This will necessitate a laptop or desktop.

## About the Course

### Curriculum

This is the fourth (and most likely last) time that I will teach this class.
The first time, the course was designed towards getting new instructors practical teaching experience.
However, I found that instructors that already had prior teaching experience didn't find the course particularly useful for them.

To address that issue, the second time I taught this course, I heavily based the curriculum on the [*Megas and Gigas Educate (MaGE)*](https://sites.google.com/a/mtholyoke.edu/mage/) program developed at [Mount Holyoke College](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/).
As they state on their website, *MaGE* is designed to:

* raise awareness of the role of social identity in learning
* emphasize active learning within computer science
* provide preparation for being technical peer mentors

The intent behind using their curriculum was to make the course more useful for students who already have teaching experience.
However, this was somewhat *too* high-level for instructors who had no teaching experience.

The third iteration of the class blended the two together.
I focused on practical teaching experience in the first half of the class, then moved on to some of the more important topics in the *MaGE* curriculum in the latter half.
My hope was that the course would prove useful to instructors across the spectrum of prior teaching experience, and I like to think that I was successful in that goal.

This fourth iteration follows the third in its goals.
However, given what's currently happening in the world and here at UC Davis, there will be a bigger focus on online teaching this time.

### Official Description

Participation as a Teaching Assistant or Associate-In in a designated engineering course.
Methods of leading discussion groups or lab sections, writing and grading quizzes, use of lab equipment, and grading lab reports.
May be repeated for credit.

### Objectives

1. Student will develop the skills to effectively lead responsive, informative discussion sections.
2. Student will be able to develop efficient and fair methods of grading student programs and tests.
3. Student will learn about the various resources available to student instructors on campus.

The whole point of this class is for you to improve as an instructor.
I get to improve as an instructor as well by teaching this class, so everyone wins!
It doesn't matter if you've had previous experience teaching or not, you can *always* improve your teaching and make things better.

### Academic Misconduct

Academic misconduct is a serious issue.
You can find the official UC Davis policy on the [Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs](https://ossja.ucdavis.edu/) website.

You are expected to cite all of the work you reference.
Any ideas that are not specifically yours or generally known should have a citation.
When in doubt, cite.

Distributing any recordings of class meetings will be considered academic misconduct.
See the [Zoom section below](#zoom) for more information.

Any violations of this policy will result in reporting the violating student(s) to the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs.
This can result in a 0 on the assignment or a U in the class.

### Student Support

As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as but not limited to:

* strained relationships
* increased anxiety
* alcohol/drug problems
* feeling down
* difficulty concentrating
* lack of motivation

These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily activities.

UC Davis is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students.
If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.
You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via [Student Health and Counseling Services](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/).
In addition, you can learn about a variety of other resources for students at UC Davis on the [Pages tab of Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800/wiki).

You can also contact myself to talk in private.
My email is listed [above](#instructor).

## Websites

### Zoom

Zoom will serve as our platform for the seminars.
Check [the Zoom tab on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800/external_tools/7164) for a link to each week's Zoom meeting.
The password for each meeting is listed on [the Canvas site's home page](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800).

Note that due to the discussion-based participatory nature of this class, I will *not* be recording the seminars.
Recording these seminars would be allowed with prior notice [according to campus counsel](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/teach).
That said, we will be discussing some sensitive topics, and I don't want anyone's exact words to be used against them later.
As [Kathy Obear](https://drkathyobear.com/) mentions in her *Suggested List of Learning Guidelines*:

> The wisdom you get from this class can leave the room, but people's words stay here.

While you can record the seminars on your own—I cannot prevent you from doing so—*distributing any recordings will be considered academic misconduct and reported to OSSJA*.
Leave people's words inside the meeting.
Furthermore, I own the copyright to any lecture recordings, so if you distribute any recordings you can get in trouble that way as well.

### GitHub

**GitHub**, which you're currently on, will serve as the open-source repository for some of the course content.
This includes:

* the syllabus (this document)
* the schedule
* any presentation notes I post
* the seminar notes for each week's class

I'm a big fan of making things open-source wherever possible, hence this repository.
My GitHub repository for [ECS 154A WQ 2020](https://github.com/jlperona-teaching/ecs154a-winter20), and other classes I've taught previously, are good examples of that.

### Canvas

[Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800) will serve as the discussion board for the class, as well as where you'll submit your assignments and get back your grades.

Feel free to post questions on the [Discussions tab](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800/discussion_topics) of Canvas.
I'll make any announcements on the [Announcements tab](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800/announcements).

## Coursework

### Grading

The course is graded on a Satisfactory / Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis.
There are 100 points possible, described in more detail in the sections below.
You need at least 80% of the points possible to get an S, as is typical of S/U classes at UC Davis, which means you can miss up to 20 points and still get an S.
Thus, if you end up missing a class or assignment once, don't worry about it.

A brief breakdown is below:

| *Category*   | *Weight* | *Explanation*                                |
|--------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Attendance   | 60%      | 10 seminars · 6 points each = 60 points      |
| Assignments  | 25%      | 10 assignments · 2.5 points each = 25 points |
| Term Project | 15%      | 15 points                                    |
| **Total**    | **100%** | **100 points**                               |

### Attendance

Attendance for each class is mandatory.
There will be some mechanism to record attendance during every seminar.
Excusing attendance for a week requires a verifiable excuse (doctor's note, etc.).

If you are unable to attend the seminars at the posted time for whatever reason, *I highly encourage you to drop and take the class in the future instead*.
You will not get nearly as much out of this class if you are unable to participate in it.
If this poses a problem for you for whatever reason—you're graduating this quarter would be one example—please email me and we can discuss alternatives.

You can get up to 6 points for each class you attend.
There are 10 classes, thus you can get 60 points from attendance.

### Weekly Assignments

In addition to the attendance, there will usually be something that you need to submit on Canvas for that week as well.
These are *usually* due at 15:00 on the following Tuesday, an hour before the next class, but check the due date carefully.
No late assignments will be accepted without a verifiable excuse (doctor's note, etc.).

Assignments will revolve around the following:

* reflection on something discussed in class that week
* reading(s) for the following week
* feedback on the course

You can get up to 2.5 points for each assignment.
There are 10 assignments, thus you can get 25 points from assignments.

### Term Project

The term project involves doing something to further your teaching outside of the classroom.

#### Background

In the past, this project was split into two different tracks.
TAs who were leading discussions this quarter would have me observe them and give feedback on their discussions.
Those who weren't leading discussions would do something to further their teaching.

Unfortunately, with the move to online teaching this quarter, observing discussions becomes a lot more difficult.
Given how little experience I have with online teaching, it's hard for me to recommend things to improve on.
Thus, I won't be making it a mandatory part of this class.
Instead, everyone will have the same assignment of doing something to further their teaching.

That said, I'm still willing to observe discussions this quarter if you'd like me to.
Email me if you'd like me to do so and we can set something up.
These extra observations would not have any bearing on the class.

#### Project Ideas

For project ideas, see the [corresponding Canvas assignment](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800/assignments/446282).

#### Project Grading

You can get up to 15 points for the term project.
If your submission is not up to my standards, I will give you a chance to resubmit rather than giving you a lower grade.
