# Week 1

Welcome to ECS 390, The Teaching of Computer Science.
**Under construction.**

Some of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Technology Rehearsal [10 min]

**Under construction.**

## Introductions [15 min]

*Get to know each other a little bit better.*

### Facilitator Introduction

I'll introduce myself to the class.
So that you (hopefully) trust me and believe that I know what I'm doing, I'll go over my background and why I'm qualified to teach this class.

### Attendance

**Under construction.**

### Student Introductions

**Under construction.**

## Class Guidelines and Expectations [25 min]

*My plans and your hopes for this class.*

### What Can You Expect?

This is a TA training program, with a focus on creating an inclusive climate for all.
You can expect there to be a lot of discussion, and to be exposed to concepts you may not have seen before.
You can also expect this to be a safe space for you to communicate your experiences and ideas.

This is a relatively new curriculum, one which I've tried before and am now modifying to (hopefully) suit your needs better.
You can expect there to be some stumbles along the way.
I ask that you be patient with me and be open to trying new things.

### What Do I Expect of You?

Some of these expectations are adapted from Kathy Obear's [*Suggested List of Learning Guidelines*](https://drkathyobear.com/).

* *Listen respectfully.* Even if you disagree with somebody, seek to understand why they feel that way.
* *Be open to new and different perspectives.* Nobody should feel ostracized because their perspective is different from somebody else.
* *Respect and maintain confidentiality.* The wisdom you get from this class can leave the room, but people's words stay here.
* *Engage the opportunity!* You'll get the most out of this course if you participate.

### Course Overview

From there, we'll go over the course [syllabus](../syllabus/syllabus.md) and [schedule](../syllabus/schedule.csv).
I'll also introduce the course websites, the grading policy, and the assignments for this quarter.

## Assignment for This Week

On [Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850), you'll have an assignment every week.
The assignment is *usually* due at 15:00 on the following Tuesday.
