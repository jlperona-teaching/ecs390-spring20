# Week 1

Welcome to ECS 390, The Teaching of Computer Science.
**Under construction.**

Some of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Technology Rehearsal [15 min]

**Under construction.**

## Introductions [15 min]

*Get to know each other a little bit better.*

### Facilitator Introduction

I'll introduce myself to the class.
So that you (hopefully) trust me and believe that I know what I'm doing, I'll go over my background and why I'm qualified to teach this class.

### Attendance

**Under construction.**

### Student Introductions

### Discussions

#### License

ucdaviscoe.zoom.us
Make sure you have your Zoom Pro license already by logging into Zoom
If not, ask your instructor to contact COE to add you

#### Setup

Recurring meeting set up through Canvas (make sure it's visible on Canvas tab)
Can also import
Also consider enable ability for students to join before you do
If another TA/instructor joins make them the co-host (have to enable co-host in settings)

#### Audio

Set option to mute everyone on coming in, make sure they can't unmute themselves in settings
Disable screen sharing on discussions so that only you can screen share

Other option is to allow students to unmute themselves and have them be honest about it
**You as the host can always mute all**

#### Recording

Option to record automatically to cloud which syncs to Canvas
Let students know lectures/discussions are being recorded (CA is 2-party consent, FERPA is a pain in the ass)

#### Chat

How to use this?
Do we want to use this?
Just depends, be consistent about it

#### Answering Student Questions

Have student raise hands for them to ask a question
Person who raise hand moves up in participant list, first come first serve
When they raise hand, unmute them. Notification pops up asking them to unmute so it doesn't come by surprise
Once you've finished answering their questions, mute them again because you can't guarantee student mute themselves

#### Screen Sharing

Webcam is optional, your face will be put to side when presenting something else

Writing? A couple of options
iPhone/iPad AirPlay
Share Screen button at bottom to select a window/screen
When sharing, hit "New Share" to change windows/screens
Might be useful to enable the annotate screen option (for yourself only)
Zoom also has a whiteboard option

#### Finish Meeting

Make sure to end meeting for all once you leave unless a co-instructor is there

### Office Hours

#### License

ucdaviscoe.zoom.us
Make sure you have your Zoom Pro license already by logging into Zoom
If not, ask your instructor to contact COE to add you

#### Setup

Recurring meeting set up through Canvas (make sure it's visible on Canvas tab)
Also consider enabling ability for students to join before you do
One-time meetings can be set up in same way without recurring
If another TA/instructor joins make them the co-host (have to enable co-host in settings)

#### Audio

Set option to mute everyone on coming in, make sure they **can** unmute themselves in settings
Disable screen sharing on discussions so that only you can screen share
Enable breakout rooms in settings beforehand
Automatically make a bunch of breakout rooms (like 50 or so) and make sure you assign manually

#### Recording

**Wouldn't** enable option to record automatically to cloud for this case
Especially with personal stuff

#### Screen Sharing

Webcam is optional, your face will be put to side when presenting something else

Writing? A couple of options
iPhone/iPad AirPlay
Share Screen button at bottom to select a window
When sharing, hit "New Share" to change windows/screens
Might be useful to enable the annotate screen option (for yourself only)
Zoom also has a whiteboard option

#### Answering Student Questions In A Group

People can unmute themselves to talk
Should be less structured and more self regulating
You can enable the option to mute/hold/kick students who are being disruptive
Good for just answering questions normally

#### Answering Student Questions Privately

Sharing solutions or other private information?
You need to be main host
Breakout rooms.
Make more rooms than participants.
Manually assign a student you want to talk to individually to breakout room to self and allow them to share screen for private stuff.
You can leave to main session once student is done.

Waiting list is another option if you want to answer everything privately

#### Finish Meeting

Make sure to end meeting for all once you leave unless a co-instructor is there

## Assignment for This Week

*Preparing for next week and beyond.*

### Discussion Leaders

On [Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850), you'll have an assignment every week.
The assignment is *usually* due at 15:00 on the following Monday.

For [this week's assignment](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372345), write down whether or not you're TAing this quarter, and if you're leading discussions.
It should take you a couple of minutes at most.
If you're not leading discussions, that's all you need to write.

If you are leading discussions, please give the class, days, times, and rooms that you're leading discussions in.
If you're not consistently leading discussions at the same time every week (because you're splitting that duty with someone else, or for any other reason) please also give the dates that you'll be leading discussions.

If you don't know because you are still discussing your duties with your instructor, please write that down as well.
I will contact you at a later date to confirm that information.

### Reading for Next Week

Also, read through *Teaching Tips We Wish They'd Told Us Before We Started* by Owen Astrachan, Nick Parlante, Daniel D. Garcia, and Stuart Reges.
This was originally published in the *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education* in 2007.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6661006/download?download_frd=1).
This is a short 2-page paper about some teaching tips for new instructors.
While this is intended for professors and lecturers, some of these tips could be applicable in your role as a TA.

You don't need to write a summary or review for this paper.
However, I would like you to review it, as it has some good information.
It also ties into TA roles and responsibilities, which we will discuss further next week.
