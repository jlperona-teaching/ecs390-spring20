# Week 1

Welcome to ECS 390, The Teaching of Computer Science.
I'll introduce myself, you'll introduce yourself to me and to other students, and I'll introduce the class.
After that, we'll talk about how to get started with online teaching.

Some of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Introductions [15 min]

*Get to know each other a little bit better.*

### Facilitator Introduction

I'll introduce myself to the class.
So that you (hopefully) trust me and believe that I know what I'm doing, I'll go over my background and why I'm qualified to teach this class.

### Attendance

### Student Introductions

## Getting Started with Online Teaching [35 min]

## Assignment for This Week

*Preparing for next week and beyond.*

### Discussion Leaders

On [Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850), you'll have an assignment every week.
The assignment is *usually* due at 15:00 on the following Monday.

For [this week's assignment](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372345), write down whether or not you're TAing this quarter, and if you're leading discussions.
It should take you a couple of minutes at most.
If you're not leading discussions, that's all you need to write.

If you are leading discussions, please give the class, days, times, and rooms that you're leading discussions in.
If you're not consistently leading discussions at the same time every week (because you're splitting that duty with someone else, or for any other reason) please also give the dates that you'll be leading discussions.

If you don't know because you are still discussing your duties with your instructor, please write that down as well.
I will contact you at a later date to confirm that information.

### Reading for Next Week

Also, read through *Teaching Tips We Wish They'd Told Us Before We Started* by Owen Astrachan, Nick Parlante, Daniel D. Garcia, and Stuart Reges.
This was originally published in the *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education* in 2007.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6661006/download?download_frd=1).
This is a short 2-page paper about some teaching tips for new instructors.
While this is intended for professors and lecturers, some of these tips could be applicable in your role as a TA.

You don't need to write a summary or review for this paper.
However, I would like you to review it, as it has some good information.
It also ties into TA roles and responsibilities, which we will discuss further next week.
