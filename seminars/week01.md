# Week 1

Welcome to a special online version of ECS 390, The Teaching of Computer Science.
This week is a trial run—[a "transition" week](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/teach), as the university is putting it.
We will try to get the technology we're using working, then we will introduce ourselves to each other.
Finally, I'll introduce the class as a whole.

Some of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Technology Rehearsal [10 min]

*Murphy's law.*

### Testing Things Out

I will use the first 10 minutes to allow you to make sure you're connected properly and that your microphone is working.
I will also use this time to point out some of the features of Zoom that we will be using during the class, especially the "raise hand" feature.

## Introductions [15 min]

*Get to know each other a little bit better.*

### Facilitator Introduction

I'll introduce myself to the class.
So that you (hopefully) trust me and believe that I know what I'm doing, I'll go over my background and why I'm qualified to teach this class.

### Student Introductions

After that, you will introduce yourself to somebody next to you that you (hopefully) don't know.
The first day sets the tone for the rest of the course, so I need to get you used to talking so that you'll continue to participate.

To do so, I'll introduce Zoom's "breakout rooms" feature, where you will be moved into a smaller room with two to three other students randomly.
Unfortunately, given the circumstances, you're not going to have many opportunities to interact with others in the class.
Therefore, use the opportunity to introduce yourself to the other people in your room!

After the allotted time for the introductions is up, I will move everyone back to the main room.
We will then continue on with the next topic.

## Class Guidelines and Expectations [25 min]

*My plans and your hopes for this class.*

### What Can You Expect?

This is a TA training program, with a focus on creating an inclusive climate for all.
You can expect there to be a lot of discussion, and to be exposed to concepts you may not have seen before.
You can also expect this to be a safe space for you to communicate your experiences and ideas.

While this isn't a new curriculum, this is the first time that I've taught it online.
You can expect there to be some stumbles along the way.
I ask that you be patient with me and be open to trying new things.

### What Do I Expect of You?

Some of these expectations are adapted from Kathy Obear's [*Suggested List of Learning Guidelines*](https://drkathyobear.com/).

* *Listen respectfully.* Even if you disagree with somebody, seek to understand why they feel that way.
* *Be open to new and different perspectives.* Nobody should feel ostracized because their perspective is different from somebody else.
* *Respect and maintain confidentiality.* The wisdom you get from this class can leave the room, but people's words stay here.
* *Engage the opportunity!* You'll get the most out of this course if you participate.

### Course Overview

From there, we'll go over the course [syllabus](../syllabus/syllabus.md) and [schedule](../syllabus/schedule.csv).
I'll also introduce the course websites, the grading policy, and the assignments for this quarter.

## Assignment for This Week

*Preparing for next week and beyond.*

### Reading

On [Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800), you'll have an assignment every week.
The assignment is *usually* due at 15:00 on the following Tuesday.

For [this week's assignment](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800/assignments/446264), answer the following question:

> How much prior experience have you had with online teaching, both as a student and as an instructor? Details about your experiences (if applicable) would be preferred.

We will be talking about how to get started with online teaching next week, but I would like to see how many of you have had experience with online teaching already, and to what extent.

As long as you respond to the question appropriately, you'll get credit.

### Reading for Next Week

Also, read through *Panel: Teaching TAs To Teach: Strategies for TA Training* by Michael Ball, Justin Hsia, Heather Pon-Barry, Andrew DeOrio, and Adam Blank.
This panel was originally slated to occur in the *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education* in 2020.
Unfortunately—as I found out two weeks ago in person—the conference was cancelled due to a ban on large gatherings in Oregon.

You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/8341146/download?download_frd=1).
This is a short 2-page paper that describes the outline behind that panel.
It talks about methods used at a variety of universities across the United States to teach TAs how to teach.

You don't need to write a summary or review for this paper.
However, I would like you to review it, as it has links to resources for TAs at other universities across the United States.
Also, Heather Bon-Parry's position statement describes the [*MaGE Program*](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home), which is what this class is based in part on.
