# Week 4

This week's focus is on educational tools, particularly those used in CS education here at UC Davis.
We will have a presenter here to talk about the various educational tools that they have used.
If there's time, then we will have a longer discussion on these tools.

## Faculty Presentation

*Advice from somebody who's been doing this for a while.*

### Presenter

Our presenter this week is Matthew Butner, a Unit 18 Lecturer in Computer Science here at UC Davis.
I've known him since 2014, when I was an undergraduate here at UC Davis.

I will ask him about [*Mimir*](https://www.mimirhq.com/) and any other educational tools that he's used.
From there, I'll let the discussion flow naturally.

## Educational Tools [if time]

*Discussing the use of educational tools and their impact on students.*

### Discussion

If we have some time left over after the presentation, we will segue into a conversation about educational tools.
I'd love to hear about the tools you're currently using and what you think works well in your classes.
I'd also like to hear about what you think *doesn't* work well in your classes.

We can also talk about other tools that didn't show up on in the paper.
There's plenty of them, but some of the ones I've heard of include:

* [*GitHub Education*](https://education.github.com/) (note: this is different than the way I use GitHub for this class)
* [*Kodethon*](https://www.kodethon.com/#/)
* [*Plickers*](https://www.plickers.com/)
* [*zyBooks*](https://www.zybooks.com/)

## Assignment for This Week

*Preparing for your small-group presentation next week.*

### Background

Next week's class will involve you giving a five-minute presentation in a breakout room of three to four other students in the class.
The topic is completely up to you, though I ask that you keep it appropriate for a classroom environment.
The people in your group will be giving anonymous feedback about your presentation via a Google Form.
You will in turn give anonymous feedback about the presentations of the members of your group via that same Google Form.

If you remember from [last week's class](./week03.md), I said that I would spend two to three hours preparing for a single hour of lecture.
Writing this document up was no exception.
I'm not expecting you to spend two to three hours preparing for this presentation, but I am expecting you to put some time in to prepare beforehand.

### Assignment

In the spirit of the above, tell me the topic that you are planning on presenting.
Submit your topic in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800/assignments/446268).
This is all you need to submit on Canvas for this week.

You will also need to put together a set of slides or other presentation aid to help you present.
PowerPoint or Google Slides makes the most sense, but if you'd prefer to use another mechanism, feel free.
You'll need to share your screen in order to share your materials with the other students in the breakout room.
Note that you do not need to submit these on Canvas for this week's assignment, but the feedback form will ask if each presenter used slides.
*If it's clear from your group's feedback that you did not prepare slides, you may not receive credit for attendance next week.*

Make sure you prepare for your presentation.
The best way to do so is to practice by speaking out loud!
I will sometimes do a practice presentation two or three times to work out all the kinks.
*If it's clear from your group's feedback that you were not prepared to present, you may not receive credit for attendance next week.*

### Grading

You will get credit for this week's assignment as long as you submit your topic by the due date.
Regarding attendance for next week, you will get credit if you do the following:

* submit your feedback form on Google Forms (the link will be provided next week)
* make a good-faith effort on your presentation (as determined by your group's feedback)
* used a set of slides for your presentation (as determined by your group's feedback)
