# Week 2

This week's focus is upon the basics of TAing.
We will talk about your role as a teaching assistant and how that changes for remote instruction, the current paradigm for teaching in the age of COVID-19.
From there, we will segue into tips and resources for remote instruction.

Some of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Purpose of Teaching Assistants [20 min]

*What hats do TAs wear?*

### Discussion

To start today, we'll have a brief discussion about the role of a TA.
This will provide context for next week's topic, which is about TA guidelines and responsibilities.

I'll ask what is the purpose and role of a TA.
There are a variety of *hats* that instructors wear over the course of their job, so I will ask you what hats you can think of.
From there, I'll let the conversation flow naturally.

### Common Responses

After we are finished discussing TA roles, I will show this list of common responses to this question for computer science TAs.
We will then discuss them.
This list isn't a definitive answer to the question, but these responses are certainly worth considering.

* TAs are there to help students who are struggling with a specific problem or bug.
* TAs are there to provide a resource for students who might not feel comfortable asking a professor for help.
* TAs are not there to provide students with answers.
* TAs are not there to tell students whether they belong in the class.

### Remote Instruction

As an introduction into the next topic, we will also have a discussion about how you think your role as a TA changes as we move teaching more online.
Here's a couple of questions I can think of:

* Do you play a larger or smaller role in students' learning when everything is online versus in person?
* Do the roles that we discussed earlier shift significantly when we move teaching online?

I don't necessarily have an answer for these myself, but I'm curious what you think.

### General Tips for Zoom

Tips in general for using Zoom as a TA.

#### Patience

Ask students to be patient during this transition period.
If it's hard on them to learn with this little notice, imagine how difficult it is for us to reconfigure to teach with that little notice!

#### License and Downloading

[ucdaviscoe.zoom.us](ucdaviscoe.zoom.us) is UC Davis College of Engineering's (CoE) portal.
Department of Computer Science is inside CoE so use that one.
Make sure you have your Zoom Pro license already by logging into Zoom.
If not, ask your instructor to contact COE to add you.

Once you have the license issues set up, you'll need to download Zoom if you want to host meetings.
It's not necessary to download it if you're only going to be attending meetings, but I'd still recommend doing so anyway.

#### Meeting Setup

Recurring meeting set up through Canvas for your discussions or office hours.
One-off meetings can be scheduled in the same way.
Make sure it's visible on Canvas tab.
You'll probably need to ask the instructor to set it up for you.

#### Meeting Settings

Set option to mute everyone on coming in.
It's never a bad idea.
Remember that **you as the host can always mute all.**

You may want to consider enabling the ability for students to join before you do, but I think that this is generally a bad idea.
This can enable Zoom-bombing.
Students can also unmute themselves if the host isn't inside, so this might be a bad idea.
If you enabled the ability for students to join before you, one of them becomes the host, which hammers the nail in the coffin.

Enable the ability to add co-hosts in settings.
If another TA or instructor joins your call, you can make them the co-host and they can do some of the management things.

Enable the ability to allow breakout rooms.
More on that below.

Disable screen sharing on discussions so that only you can screen share.
Partially for Zoom-bombing reasons, but also so that students don't share their code or answers.
This option (and the mute all) gets overridden inside breakout rooms, so don't worry about meeting students individually and them not being able to share their screen or talk.

#### Screen Sharing

Webcam is optional, not truly necessary.
Your face will be put to side when presenting something else, and students can control options on the cameras, so don't worry about that.

Share Screen button at bottom to select a window to share, such as a PowerPoint.
When sharing, hit "New Share" to change windows/screens.
Might be useful to enable the annotate screen option (for yourself only), then you can draw on your PowerPoint or other presentation.

Want to write?
You have a few options.
iPhone/iPad AirPlay is best if you have one of those.
Otherwise, some form of tablet with a stylus makes drawing so much easier.

Zoom also has a whiteboard option.
Using this with a mouse is definitely difficult, though.

#### Chat

How do you use chat, and do you want to use it?
Just depends, be consistent about it.

Some instructors use it to get answers from students, but there is the participation markers (similar to the Raise Hand feature) and polls (which you need to enable in settings) that can also be used for that feature.

Some instructors use it to ask for questions from students, but the Raise Hand feature is better about notifying the host that there's a question compared to attempting to constantly look at chat.
Especially true if you're using an iPad or other table to scribe, since you can't see chat on there.

Also prevent chat from becoming Twitch chat if you do decide to use the chat.
This is a professional environment.
You may need to remind students (or threaten to stop using the chat) if they behave inappropriately.
Chat can get recorded much like the actual lecture so they should mind what they say.

Remember you can also kick individual users if they're behaving inappropriately.

#### Finishing a Meeting

Make sure to end meeting for all once you leave unless a co-instructor is there.
If you enabled the ability for students to join before you, one of them becomes the host, which is bad.
You'll also want to make sure the recording gets ended, and ending the meeting will do that.

### Discussions

Tips specifically for leading discussions.

#### Audio

Make sure they can't unmute themselves in settings so that they don't interrupt you while you're leading the discussion.

Other option is to allow students to unmute themselves and have them be honest about it, but wouldn't recommend this.
Remember that **you as the host can always mute all.**

#### Recording

Option to record automatically to cloud which syncs to Canvas.
Recordings are great for students who can't make it at the scheduled discussion time.

Let students know lectures and discussions are being recorded inside the syllabus and at the beginning of each class session.
CA is a two-party consent which means that you need to inform everybody when they're being recorded.
FERPA protects recordings of students and you don't want to mess with that.

#### Answering Student Questions

Have student raise hands for them to ask a question.
Raise hand button is in the participant box, same place you'd look to see if somebody is raising their hand.

Person who raise hand moves up in participant list, first come first serve.
When they raise hand, unmute them.
Notification pops up asking them to unmute so it doesn't come by surprise.

Once you've finished answering their questions, mute them again.
You can't guarantee student mute themselves, but most are generally good about it.

### Office Hours

Tips specifically for leading office hours.

#### Audio

Up to you if you want students to have the ability so they **can** unmute themselves in the settings.
Office hours should be less structured and more self-regulating than a discussion.
Students are generally good about respecting boundaries here.
You can always change this later in case it becomes a problem.
It's up to you, though.

#### Recording

I **wouldn't** enable option to record automatically to cloud for office hours.
Especially since personal stuff will probably be discussed or student answers shared.
It's not a good idea.

#### Answering Student Questions In A Group

People can unmute themselves to talk, or they can raise hand to be unmuted.
Just depends on what you selected earlier.
Good for just answering questions normally that aren't private.

You can enable the option to mute/hold/kick students who are being disruptive.

#### Answering Student Questions Privately

I mentioned earlier that you'll want to enable breakout rooms; this is why.
Make sure to enable breakout rooms in the settings beforehand.
You need to be the main host (not co-host) to use breakout rooms.

Have Zoom automatically make a bunch of breakout rooms, say 10 or so.
Make sure to assign students manually, not automatically, when doing so.
Otherwise you'll assign everyone out of the main session, which you don't want.

Sharing solutions or other private information with a single student?
Time to use those breakout rooms.
Manually assign a student you want to talk to individually to a breakout room.
Also assign yourself to the breakout room.
Breakout room overrides the typical settings on sharing screens and muting, so they should be able to share and talk immediately.

Main session will continue to go on while you're in the breakout room.
You can leave to main session once student is done.
You may want another TA (basically, hold joint office hours) so that somebody else is in the room while you discuss privately with another student.
Otherwise students will be confused as to why there's no TA inside the Zoom call!

Waiting list is another option if you want to answer everything privately.
Throughput on the waiting list is much lower, though.

## Other Resources for Remote Instruction [5 min]

*Further reading to help you improve your ability to teach remotely.*

### Resource List

To finish off today, I will briefly go over a list of resources for remote instruction and online teaching.
I've been compiling this list from the vast amount of discussion that's been going on ever since universities started reacting to the current crisis.

If you know of any other resources that you believe would be useful, please let me know and I'd be happy to add it to the list.

#### UC Davis Department of Psychology

UC Davis' Department of Psychology has been standing out in terms of preparing their instructional staff for remote teaching, hence why it's first on the list of the resources.
Their [plan for instructional continuity](https://sites.google.com/ucdavis.edu/ucdavis-psychology-plan-s2020/home) for Spring Quarter 2020 has been shared widely throughout the academic community here at UC Davis for its quality.
You'll definitely want to have a look at this if you're teaching this quarter.

In particular, you're going to want to look at their [shared materials](https://sites.google.com/ucdavis.edu/ucdavis-psychology-plan-s2020/shared-materials).
As I mentioned earlier, their [slides from the training meeting for their TAs](https://www.dropbox.com/s/miejilg32ooa0k9/Zoom%20Training%20Meeting%20for%20Psych%20TAs.pdf?dl=0) is probably the best place to get started or learn more about using Zoom.

#### Keep Teaching

UC Davis has created their own webpage for instructors to [*Keep Teaching*](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/).
This is focused upon "instructional resilience" and is meant more towards faculty, but there could be some helpful information on there for you to look over.
You'll probably want to look at the [*Teach*](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/teach) page in particular, since that's what you'll be doing.

Of course, many other universities are doing the same thing and putting together their own pages for their instructional staff to keep teaching.
Check out [this crowdsourced Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VT9oiNYPyiEsGHBoDKlwLlWAsWP58sGV7A3oIuEUG3k) that contains links to other universities' pages on continuing to teach during this time.

You may also want to check out this list of [*Resources for STEM Education Centers in Response to COVID-19*](https://serc.carleton.edu/StemEdCenters/news/236312.html) by the [*Network of STEM Education Centers*](https://serc.carleton.edu/StemEdCenters/index.html) at Carleton College.
Specifically, the "disciplinary resources on teaching remotely" may be helpful for best practices on remote teaching.

#### Keep Learning

There's also resources specifically directed at students to [*Keep Learning*](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/student-resources).
You can forward this to the students in the class you're TAing for so that they can get help with any issues they're encountering.
Also, all of you are students, so this may be worthwhile to read for the classes you're taking.

## Assignment for This Week

*Advice from those who have been doing this for a while.*

### Reading

Read through *Teaching Tips We Wish They'd Told Us Before We Started* by Owen Astrachan, Nick Parlante, Daniel D. Garcia, and Stuart Reges.
This panel occurred in the *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education* in 2007.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/8235248/download?download_frd=1).

The layout for this short two-page paper is similar to the paper from last week, which you hopefully have read.
It contains some teaching tips for new instructors.
While this is intended for professors and lecturers, some of these tips could be applicable in your role as a TA.

### Questions

You don't need to write a formal review of the paper.
Instead, answer the following two questions:

1. Are there any tips in the paper that you think may be helpful for your own teaching in the future?
2. Are there any tips *not* on this list that you've heard in the past that you think may be worth mentioning to the rest of the class?

Submit your responses in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800/assignments/446266).
I may share some of the responses to this assignment *anonymously* in class next week, so please keep that in mind if you are going to discuss something sensitive.

### Grading

As long as you respond to the questions appropriately, you'll get credit.
