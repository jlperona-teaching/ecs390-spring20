# Week 2

This week's focus is upon the basics of TAing.
We will talk about your role as a teaching assistant and how that changes for remote instruction, the current paradigm for teaching in the age of COVID-19.
From there, we will segue into tips and resources for remote instruction.

Some of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Purpose of Teaching Assistants [15 min]

*What hats do TAs wear?*

### Discussion

To start today, we'll have a brief discussion about the role of a TA.
This will provide context for next week's topic, which is about TA guidelines and responsibilities.

I'll ask what is the purpose and role of a TA.
There are a variety of *hats* that instructors wear over the course of their job, so I will ask you what hats you can think of.
From there, I'll let the conversation flow naturally.

### Common Responses

After we are finished discussing TA roles, I will show this list of common responses to this question for computer science TAs.
We will then discuss them.
This list isn't a definitive answer to the question, but these responses are certainly worth considering.

* TAs are there to help students who are struggling with a specific problem or bug.
* TAs are there to provide a resource for students who might not feel comfortable asking a professor for help.
* TAs are not there to provide students with answers.
* TAs are not there to tell students whether they belong in the class.

### Remote Instruction

As an introduction into the next topic, we will also have a discussion about how you think your role as a TA changes as we move teaching more online.
Here's a couple of questions I can think of:

* Do you play a larger or smaller role in students' learning when everything is online versus in person?
* Do the roles that we discussed earlier shift significantly when we move teaching online?

I don't necessarily have an answer for these myself, but I'm curious what you think.

## Introduction to Remote Instruction and Zoom [35 min]

*Tips and tricks to make Zoom tick.*

### Introduction

After this brief introductory section, we will talk about getting started with *remote instruction* on Zoom.
Some of these recommendations may be applicable to tools outside Zoom, but since Zoom is the one that UC has a contract with for video conferencing, we'll stick to that one.

### Remote Instruction versus Online Learning

I'd like to make a clarifying comment before we move any further.
If you're wondering why "remote instruction" was italicized in the previous section, it's because "remote instruction" is different than "online learning."
The difference is explained on [this page](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/teach/planning-remote-instruction/remote-instruction-vs-online-learning) on UC Davis' *Keep Teaching* website, but it comes down to best practices.
If we were moving to online teaching, we would try our best to use best practices for that online teaching and learning.
There's been a lot of research done on determining those best practices, which differ from best practices for in-person teaching.

Unfortunately, given the circumstances of our move online, many instructors don't have the time or resources to adequately implement best practices.
Many of us are trying our best, but very few of us have done this before.
I would assume the same applies to you.
If you're teaching this quarter, *do your best, but don't expect to get everything perfect.*
You will make mistakes, just as I'm sure I'll make mistakes trying to move this class online, and that's okay.
Given what's currently going on in the world, I think it's completely acceptable to not be perfect in your teaching right now.

### Zoom Training Slides

What I've written in the notes we'll go over in the next section assumes a bit of familiarity with Zoom already.
I've tried to focus on the little "gotchas" that I found while working with Zoom.

If you have very little experience with using Zoom as a host, I'd recommend going through the slides from the UC Davis Department of Psychology's [training meeting for their TAs](https://www.dropbox.com/s/miejilg32ooa0k9/Zoom%20Training%20Meeting%20for%20Psych%20TAs.pdf?dl=0).
Some things that they mention in their slides are going to be slightly different for you, but in general.

### Notes for Using Zoom

From here, we will move on to our main topic for today and talk about tips for Zoom.
You can find these [in the notes subdirectory of this repository](../notes/tips-for-zoom.md).

I'm a big supporter of open source materials.
Feel free to make an issue or pull request here on GitHub in case you'd like to add anything and make these notes better.

### Other Resources for Remote Instruction

In [the same notes we just looked at](../notes/tips-for-zoom.md), I've also included a section on other resources for remote instruction.
To finish today, we will go over those briefly in case you need additional assistance with teaching this quarter.

## Assignment for This Week

*Advice from those who have been doing this for a while.*

### Reading

Read through *Teaching Tips We Wish They'd Told Us Before We Started* by Owen Astrachan, Nick Parlante, Daniel D. Garcia, and Stuart Reges.
This panel occurred in the *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education* in 2007.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/8235248/download?download_frd=1).

The layout for this short two-page paper is similar to the paper from last week, which you hopefully have read.
It contains some teaching tips for new instructors.
While this is intended for professors and lecturers, some of these tips could be applicable in your role as a TA.

### Questions

You don't need to write a formal review of the paper.
Instead, answer the following two questions:

1. Are there any tips in the paper that you think may be helpful for your own teaching in the future?
2. Are there any tips *not* on this list that you've heard in the past that you think may be worth mentioning to the rest of the class?

Submit your responses in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800/assignments/446266).
I may share some of the responses to this assignment *anonymously* in class next week, so please keep that in mind if you are going to discuss something sensitive.

### Grading

As long as you respond to the questions appropriately, you'll get credit.
