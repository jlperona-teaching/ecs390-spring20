# Week 2

**Under construction.**

## Purpose of Teaching Assistants [15 min]

*What hats do TAs wear?*

### Discussion

To finish today, we'll have a brief discussion about the role of a TA.
This will provide context for next week's topic, which is about TA guidelines and responsibilities.

I'll ask what is the purpose and role of a TA.
There are a variety of *hats* that instructors wear over the course of their job, so I will ask you what hats you can think of.
From there, I'll let the conversation flow naturally.

### Common Responses

To finish our discussion, I will show this list of common responses to this question for computer science TAs; we will then discuss them.
This list isn't a definitive answer to the question, but these responses are certainly worth considering.

* TAs are there to help students who are struggling with a specific problem or bug.
* TAs are there to provide a resource for students who might not feel comfortable asking a professor for help.
* TAs are not there to provide students with answers.
* TAs are not there to tell students whether they belong in the class.

## Getting Started with Online Teaching [35 min]

### Discussions

#### License

ucdaviscoe.zoom.us
Make sure you have your Zoom Pro license already by logging into Zoom
If not, ask your instructor to contact COE to add you

#### Setup

Recurring meeting set up through Canvas (make sure it's visible on Canvas tab)
Can also import
Also consider enable ability for students to join before you do
If another TA/instructor joins make them the co-host (have to enable co-host in settings)

#### Audio

Set option to mute everyone on coming in, make sure they can't unmute themselves in settings
Disable screen sharing on discussions so that only you can screen share

Other option is to allow students to unmute themselves and have them be honest about it
**You as the host can always mute all**

#### Recording

Option to record automatically to cloud which syncs to Canvas
Let students know lectures/discussions are being recorded (CA is 2-party consent, FERPA is a pain in the ass)

#### Chat

How to use this?
Do we want to use this?
Just depends, be consistent about it

#### Answering Student Questions

Have student raise hands for them to ask a question
Person who raise hand moves up in participant list, first come first serve
When they raise hand, unmute them. Notification pops up asking them to unmute so it doesn't come by surprise
Once you've finished answering their questions, mute them again because you can't guarantee student mute themselves

#### Screen Sharing

Webcam is optional, your face will be put to side when presenting something else

Writing? A couple of options
iPhone/iPad AirPlay
Share Screen button at bottom to select a window/screen
When sharing, hit "New Share" to change windows/screens
Might be useful to enable the annotate screen option (for yourself only)
Zoom also has a whiteboard option

#### Finish Meeting

Make sure to end meeting for all once you leave unless a co-instructor is there

### Office Hours

#### License

ucdaviscoe.zoom.us
Make sure you have your Zoom Pro license already by logging into Zoom
If not, ask your instructor to contact COE to add you

#### Setup

Recurring meeting set up through Canvas (make sure it's visible on Canvas tab)
Also consider enabling ability for students to join before you do
One-time meetings can be set up in same way without recurring
If another TA/instructor joins make them the co-host (have to enable co-host in settings)

#### Audio

Set option to mute everyone on coming in, make sure they **can** unmute themselves in settings
Disable screen sharing on discussions so that only you can screen share
Enable breakout rooms in settings beforehand
Automatically make a bunch of breakout rooms (like 50 or so) and make sure you assign manually

#### Recording

**Wouldn't** enable option to record automatically to cloud for this case
Especially with personal stuff

#### Screen Sharing

Webcam is optional, your face will be put to side when presenting something else

Writing? A couple of options
iPhone/iPad AirPlay
Share Screen button at bottom to select a window
When sharing, hit "New Share" to change windows/screens
Might be useful to enable the annotate screen option (for yourself only)
Zoom also has a whiteboard option

#### Answering Student Questions In A Group

People can unmute themselves to talk
Should be less structured and more self regulating
You can enable the option to mute/hold/kick students who are being disruptive
Good for just answering questions normally

#### Answering Student Questions Privately

Sharing solutions or other private information?
You need to be main host
Breakout rooms.
Make more rooms than participants.
Manually assign a student you want to talk to individually to breakout room to self and allow them to share screen for private stuff.
You can leave to main session once student is done.

Waiting list is another option if you want to answer everything privately

#### Finish Meeting

Make sure to end meeting for all once you leave unless a co-instructor is there

## Assignment for This Week

*Tools and other technology to make your teaching more effective.*

### Reading

Read through *Teaching Tips We Wish They'd Told Us Before We Started* by Owen Astrachan, Nick Parlante, Daniel D. Garcia, and Stuart Reges.
This was originally published in the *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education* in 2007.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6661006/download?download_frd=1).
This is a short 2-page paper about some teaching tips for new instructors.
While this is intended for professors and lecturers, some of these tips could be applicable in your role as a TA.
