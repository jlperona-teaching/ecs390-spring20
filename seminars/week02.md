# Week 2

This week, we'll talk about the different *hats* that TAs wear.
The focus is on your responsibilities as a TA.
We'll discuss some guidelines and responsibilities for being a TA in CS at UC Davis.

## Class Guidelines and Expectations [25 min]

*My plans and your hopes for this class.*

### What Can You Expect?

This is a TA training program, with a focus on creating an inclusive climate for all.
You can expect there to be a lot of discussion, and to be exposed to concepts you may not have seen before.
You can also expect this to be a safe space for you to communicate your experiences and ideas.

This is a relatively new curriculum, one which I've tried before and am now modifying to (hopefully) suit your needs better.
You can expect there to be some stumbles along the way.
I ask that you be patient with me and be open to trying new things.

### What Do I Expect of You?

Some of these expectations are adapted from Kathy Obear's [*Suggested List of Learning Guidelines*](https://drkathyobear.com/).

* *Listen respectfully.* Even if you disagree with somebody, seek to understand why they feel that way.
* *Be open to new and different perspectives.* Nobody should feel ostracized because their perspective is different from somebody else.
* *Respect and maintain confidentiality.* The wisdom you get from this class can leave the room, but people's words stay here.
* *Engage the opportunity!* You'll get the most out of this course if you participate.

### Course Overview

From there, we'll go over the course [syllabus](../syllabus/syllabus.md) and [schedule](../syllabus/schedule.csv).
I'll also introduce the course websites, the grading policy, and the assignments for this quarter.

## Purpose of TAs [10 min]

*What hats do TAs wear?*

### Discussion

To finish today, we'll have a brief discussion about the role of a TA.
This will provide context for next week's topic, which is about TA guidelines and responsibilities.

I'll ask what is the purpose and role of a TA.
There are a variety of *hats* that instructors wear over the course of their job, so I will ask you what hats you can think of.
From there, I'll let the conversation flow naturally.

### Common Responses

To finish our discussion, I will show this list of common responses to this question for computer science TAs; we will then discuss them.
This list isn't a definitive answer to the question, but these responses are certainly worth considering.

* TAs are there to help students who are struggling with a specific problem or bug.
* TAs are there to provide a resource for students who might not feel comfortable asking a professor for help.
* TAs are not there to provide students with answers.
* TAs are not there to tell students whether they belong in the class.

## Assignment for This Week

*Preparing for next week and beyond.*
