# Week 3

This week's focus is on your responsibilities as a TA.
We'll discuss some guidelines and responsibilities for being a TA in CS at UC Davis.

## Term Project Details [10 min]

*Your "big" assignment for this quarter.*

### Background

Before we move on to the main topic for today, I am going to briefly discuss the term project for this quarter.
For background on what the term project is about, see [this section of the syllabus](https://github.com/jlperona-teaching/ecs390-spring20/blob/master/syllabus/syllabus.md#term-project).
For ideas on what to do for the term project, see the [Furthering Your Teaching assignment](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800/assignments/446282) on Canvas.

### Questions

I will answer any questions you may have about the project.
Once I have answered your questions, we will move on.

## Teaching Assistant Guidelines and Responsibilities [40 min]

*Guidance for teaching CS at UC Davis.*

### Notes

Last week we discussed roles of a TA.
Now that we have some context for what you do as a TA, we're going to go over some guidelines and responsibilities for teaching CS here at UC Davis.
Note that these guidelines were written before the move to remote instruction, so some of these won't be applicable this quarter.
That said, we're not going to be teaching remotely forever, so I think that it's still important to cover them.

These notes were originally developed by Sean Davis, who was a long-time lecturer here before retiring a couple of years ago.
I took his version of this and added some of my own observations and notes to it.
You can find the PDF version of it [here on GitHub](../notes/teaching-guidelines-responsibilities.pdf).

Going over the entire document would probably take a couple of hours.
Instead, we're going to go over points that I think are particularly important, which are **bolded** in the document.

## Assignment for This Week

*Tools and other technology to make your teaching more effective.*

### Reading

Read through *Technology We Can't Live Without!, revisited* by Ria Galanos, Michael Ball, John Dougherty, Joe Hummel, and David J. Malan.
This was originally published in the *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education* in 2018.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6661077/download?download_frd=1).
This is a short 2-page paper about tools used in computer science education.
The presentation next week will talk about some tools in use at UC Davis, and we'll have a discussion if there's time.

### Questions

You don't need to write a formal review of the paper.
Instead, answer the following three questions:

1. Have you used, or are currently using, any of the educational tools that the authors mentioned?
2. Are there any tools on this list that you haven't used that may be useful to you in the future?
3. Are there any tools *not* on this list that you think are worth mentioning?

Submit your responses in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310492).

### Grading

As long as you respond to the questions appropriately, you'll get credit.
