# Week 3

This week's focus is on your responsibilities as a TA.
We'll discuss some guidelines and responsibilities for being a TA in CS at UC Davis.

## Teaching Assistant Guidelines and Responsibilities [50 min]

*Guidance for teaching CS at UC Davis.*

### Poll

Before we continue, I want to see how many students have been or are currently TAs.
Interestingly enough, this information (particularly on whether you've TAed in the past) isn't easily available, even to someone who is teaching a TA training course!
I'll use the results to this question to tailor the next section appropriately.

**Under construction.**

Afterwards, I will collect the questionnaire and count them.
When I have finished counting, I will reveal the results in the aggregate.

### Notes

Now that we have some context, we're going to go over some guidelines and responsibilities for teaching CS here at UC Davis.
This was originally developed by Sean Davis, who was a long-time lecturer here before retiring a couple of years ago (though you might see him around next quarter).
I took his version of this and added some of my own observations and notes to it.
You can find the PDF version of it [here on GitHub](../notes/teaching-guidelines-responsibilities.pdf).

Going over the entire document would probably take a couple of hours.
Instead, we're going to go over points that I think are particularly important, which are **bolded** in the document.

## Assignment for This Week

*Preparing for your small-group presentation next week.*

### Background

Next week's class will involve you giving a five-minute presentation (along with time at the end to answer a question from everyone) in front of a group of four to five of your fellow students in the class.
The topic is completely up to you, though I ask that you keep it appropriate for a classroom environment.
The people in your group will be giving anonymous feedback about your presentation.
You will in turn give anonymous feedback about the presentations of the members of your group.
Note that you won't have a projector or a board to use, so you'll need to present without those things.

If you remember from [last week's class](./week02.md), I said that I would spend two to three hours preparing for a single hour of lecture.
Writing this document up was no exception.
I'm not expecting you to spend two to three hours preparing for this presentation, but I am expecting you to put some time in to prepare beforehand.

### Assignment

In the spirit of the above, tell me the topic that you are planning on presenting.
Submit your topic in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372348).
This is all you need to submit on Canvas for this week.

You will also need to put together a set of presentation notes or aids to help you present.
I'm not mandating the style of notes that you put together.
You can use bullet points, flash cards, lecture notes, or any other method that will help you present.
*You do not need to submit these on Canvas for this week's assignment, but I will collect them after your presentation next week.*

Make sure you prepare for your presentation.
The best way to do so is to practice by speaking out loud!
I will sometimes do a practice presentation two or three times to work out all the kinks.
*If it's clear from your group's feedback that you were not prepared to present, you may not receive credit for attendance next week.*

### Grading

You will get credit for this week's assignment as long as you submit your topic by the due date.
Regarding attendance for next week, you will get credit if you do the following:

* make a good-faith effort on your presentation (as determined by your group's feedback).
* turn in your filled-in feedback form (passed out in class next week).
* turn in your presentation notes that you used for the presentation (make sure to write your name down on your notes).
