# Week 5

This week's class involves you giving an online presentation in front of a group of your fellow students.
The people in your group will be giving you anonymous feedback about your presentation.
You, in turn, will give anonymous feedback about the presentations by the other members of your group.

## Small-Group Presentations [50 min]

*Practicing your ability to speak in front of other people.*

### Background

In the past, ECS 390 was primarily presentation-based.
It used to be that one student presented in front of the rest of the class, emulating a real discussion section.
However, this takes a significant amount of time for everybody to have even a small bit of time to present.
With the increase in the number of students who want to take this class (as indicated by the waitlist sizes) it would take a significant amount of class meetings to keep doing this.
We also can't have presentations in person this quarter due to the pandemic.

Instead, you will present virtually in front of a smaller group.
The topic can be about whatever you like, so long as it's appropriate for the classroom setting.
This unfortunately doesn't allow us to emulate what a real discussion section would feel like, and it definitely doesn't emulate what it's really like to present in front of people.
Given the circumstances, I'll take what I can get, though.
At the very least, you will get some practice with presenting on Zoom if you haven't had the opportunity to do so yet.

### Preparation

As noted in the [assignment from the previous week](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461800/assignments/446268), I want you to prepare for this presentation.
That assignment asked you what you planned on presenting.
In addition to that, you need to have prepared a set of slides or presentation aids to help you present.
As I mentioned in the [presentation notes from week 3](../notes/teaching-guidelines-responsibilities.pdf), you should never go into a discussion unprepared.
The same applies here.

*You will not receive credit for attendance this week if you didn't use slides or other form of presentation aid.
You will also not receive credit if you didn't make a good-faith effort on your presentation.*

#### Presentation Aid

I am not mandating exactly what type of presentation aid that you use.
PowerPoint or Google Slides makes the most sense, but if you'd prefer to use another mechanism, feel free.
I am also not mandating their length or how much detail you put on them.

Everybody has a different method that they like to use to help them present.
For example, in this class I present off the notes you are reading now, which are long-form and are written to be student-facing.
On the other hand, when I am teaching a traditional lecture, I use an outline that I provide to the students beforehand, such as [this one](https://github.com/jlperona-teaching/ecs154a-winter20/blob/master/outlines/01.pdf) from when I taught ECS 154A.
As I go through the lecture, I fill in the outline.
You can use whatever style works for you, or try out a new one if you'd like.

#### Practicing

I also want you to have prepared for the presentation.
The best way to do so is by speaking out loud and actually going through your presentation.
I will sometimes do a practice presentation two or three times to test it out.
If I catch something, I'll edit my notes and repeat it again until I'm happy with how things turned out.
You should practice your presentation at least once before class.

### In Class

#### Feedback for Others

Before we start the presentations, I will send a link to the Google Form that we will be using via Zoom's chat feature.
Follow the instructions on the feedback form itself once we get started with the presentations.
*You will need to submit this Google Form in order to receive credit for today's attendance.*

There are five feedback sections for you to fill out during and after each presentation in your breakout room.
This includes yourself; give feedback on your own presentation after you're done with it.
If your group has less than 5 people, there will be an extra feedback section.
You can write "N/A" for each answer in that one.

#### Presentation Groups and Timing

You will be in a breakout room on Zoom with three to four other students, so four to five students total.
The groups will be assigned randomly.
I will rotate through the breakout rooms to monitor your progress.

Your presentation should take around 4-5 minutes; somebody in your group should time each presentation as that's a question on the feedback form.
I will send a message via Zoom's chat feature to all the breakout rooms every 7-8 minutes to let groups know that they should be finishing up with the current presenter and starting the next presentation.

#### Attendance and Returning Feedback

At the end of the class, please submit your feedback form.
You will receive credit for attendance this week if you did the following:

* submit your feedback form
* make a good-faith effort on your presentation (as determined by your group's feedback)
* used a set of slides for your presentation (as determined by your group's feedback)

Your feedback will remain anonymous as long as you didn't write your name down on the individual feedback sections.
I will return each person's feedback next week after collating the information from the Google Form.

## Assignment for This Week

*Introducing the concept of Universal Design for Learning.*

### Reading

Read through *Universal Design: Implications for Computing Education* by Sheryl Burgstahler of the University of Washington, Seattle.
This was originally published in *ACM Transactions on Computing Education* in 2011.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6661078/download?download_frd=1).
We will discuss the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) next week.

### Review

The review format is adapted from the format for the [paper reviews for ECS 201C](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS201C/blob/master/syllabus.md#paper-reviews) by Jason Lowe-Power.

Write a review of the reading above.
Your review should contain two short paragraphs:

1. A short summary of the reading, and any key insights or implications.
2. Your own thoughts about the reading. Anything that stood out or resonated with you, or a topic/question about it for next week.

Submit your review in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372349).

### Grading

I'm looking to see if you read the paper.
I am not going to grade this that harshly.
That being said, if it's clear from your review that you didn't read the paper, you may not receive full credit.
