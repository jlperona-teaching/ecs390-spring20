# Week 5

This week's class involves you giving a presentation in front of a small group of your fellow students.
The people in your group will be giving you anonymous feedback about your presentation.
You, in turn, will give anonymous feedback about the presentations by the other members of your group.

## Small-Group Presentations [50 min]

*Practicing your ability to speak in front of other people.*

### Background

In the past, ECS 390 was primarily presentation-based.
It used to be that one student presented in front of the rest of the class, emulating a real discussion section.
However, this takes a significant amount of time for everybody to have even a small bit of time to present.
With the increase in the number of students who want to take this class (as indicated by the waitlist sizes) it would take a significant amount of class meetings to keep doing this.

Instead, you will present in front of a smaller group.
The topic can be about whatever you like, so long as it's appropriate for the classroom setting.
This unfortunately doesn't allow us to emulate what a real discussion section would feel like, but it still lets you practice your presentation skills.
Some students have had plenty of teaching experience before and thus plenty of experience with presentations.
On the other hand, some students have had not gotten the chance to present in front of a crowd before.
Either way, you will get some more practice today, and hopefully the feedback from your groupmates will help you improve your presentation skills.

### Preparation

As noted in the [assignment from the previous week](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372348), I want you to prepare for this presentation.
That assignment asked you what you planned on presenting.
In addition to that, you need to have prepared a set of presentation notes or aids to help you present.
As I mentioned in the [presentation notes from week 2](../notes/teaching-guidelines-responsibilities.pdf), you should never go into a discussion unprepared.
The same applies here.

*You will not receive credit for attendance this week if you don't turn in your presentation notes or if you didn't make a good-faith effort on your presentation.*

#### Presentation Notes

I am not mandating the style of notes that you use, nor their length.
Everybody has a different method that they like to use to help them present; few people can truly "wing" a presentation well without notes.
For example, the notes you are reading now are long-form and are written to be student-facing, but I still use them as a presentation aid in class.
On the other hand, my notes for when I am teaching a traditional lecture (such as [these notes](https://github.com/jlperona-teaching/ecs154a-ssii18/blob/master/notes/1.14.pdf) from when I taught ECS 154A) are shorter and are designed for me, but also readable by students.
You can use whatever style works for you: bullet points, flash cards, or any other method that helps you present.

#### Practicing

I also want you to have prepared for the presentation.
The best way to do so is by speaking out loud and actually going through your presentation.
I will sometimes do a practice presentation two or three times to test it out.
If I catch something, I'll edit my notes and repeat it again until I'm happy with how things turned out.
You should practice your presentation at least once before class.

### In Class

#### Presentation Groups and Timing

You will be in a group with four other students, so five students total.
Your presentation should take around 4-5 minutes; somebody in your group should time each presentation as that's a question on the feedback form.
After your presentation has finished, there will be approximately 2-3 minutes where each person in your group will ask you a question.
This is to help you practice repeating students' questions.

I will call out every seven minutes to let groups know that they should be finishing up with the current presenter and starting the next presentation.

#### Feedback for Others

Before we start the presentations, I will pass out a feedback form to everyone.
You can find a copy of that feedback form [here on GitHub](../notes/presentation-feedback.pdf).
Follow the instructions on the feedback form itself once we get started with the presentations.
Also, *make sure to write your name down on your notes that you are going to use for your presentation*, as you will need to turn those in as well.

There are four feedback sections for you to fill out during and after the presentation for the other people in your group.
Additionally, there is a section for you to fill out after your own presentation.

#### Attendance and Returning Feedback

At the end of the class, I will collect everyone's feedback forms and presentation notes.
You will receive credit for attendance this week if you did the following:

* make a good-faith effort on your presentation (as determined by your group's feedback).
* turn in your filled-in feedback form (passed out at the beginning of class).
* turn in your presentation notes that you used for the presentation (make sure to write your name down on your notes).

Your feedback will remain anonymous as long as you didn't write your name down on the individual feedback sections.
You might have noticed that the feedback form was divided into sections and that I asked for your name at the top.
Your name is for attendance for this week.
I will separate all your filled feedback sections out from your name, group each feedback section by person, and return each person's feedback next week.

## Assignment for This Week

*Tools and other technology to make your teaching more effective.*

### Reading

Read through *Technology We Can't Live Without!, revisited* by Ria Galanos, Michael Ball, John Dougherty, Joe Hummel, and David J. Malan.
This was originally published in the *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education* in 2018.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6661077/download?download_frd=1).
This is a short 2-page paper about tools used in computer science education.
The presentation next week will talk about some tools in use at UC Davis, and we'll have a discussion if there's time.

### Questions

You don't need to write a formal review of the paper.
Instead, answer the following three questions:

1. Have you used, or are currently using, any of the educational tools that the authors mentioned?
2. Are there any tools on this list that you haven't used that may be useful to you in the future?
3. Are there any tools *not* on this list that you think are worth mentioning?

Submit your responses in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310492).

### Grading

As long as you respond to the questions appropriately, you'll get credit.
