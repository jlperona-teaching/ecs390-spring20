# Week 5

This week's focus is on educational tools, particularly those used in CS education here at UC Davis.
We will have a presenter here to talk about the various educational tools that they have used.
If there's time, then we will have a longer discussion on these tools.

## Faculty Presentation

*Advice from somebody who's been doing this for a while.*

### Presenter

**Under construction.**

### Attendance

**Under construction.**

## Educational Tools [if time]

*Discussing the use of educational tools and their impact on students.*

### Discussion

If we have some time left over after the presentation, we will segue into a conversation about educational tools.
I'd love to hear about the tools you're currently using and what you think works well in your classes.
I'd also like to hear about what you think *doesn't* work well in your classes.

We can also talk about other tools that didn't show up on in the paper.
There's plenty of them, but some of the ones I've heard of include:

* [*GitHub Education*](https://education.github.com/) (note: this is different than the way I use GitHub for this class)
* [*Kodethon*](https://www.kodethon.com/#/)
* [*Mimir*](https://www.mimirhq.com/)
* [*Plickers*](https://www.plickers.com/)
* [*zyBooks*](https://www.zybooks.com/)

## Assignment for This Week

*Introducing the concept of Universal Design for Learning.*

### Reading

Read through *Universal Design: Implications for Computing Education* by Sheryl Burgstahler of the University of Washington, Seattle.
This was originally published in *ACM Transactions on Computing Education* in 2011.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6661078/download?download_frd=1).
We will discuss the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) next week.

### Review

The review format is adapted from the format for the [paper reviews for ECS 201C](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS201C/blob/master/syllabus.md#paper-reviews) by Jason Lowe-Power.

Write a review of the reading above.
Your review should contain two short paragraphs:

1. A short summary of the reading, and any key insights or implications.
2. Your own thoughts about the reading. Anything that stood out or resonated with you, or a topic/question about it for next week.

Submit your review in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372349).

### Grading

I'm looking to see if you read the paper.
I am not going to grade this that harshly.
That being said, if it's clear from your review that you didn't read the paper, you may not receive full credit.
