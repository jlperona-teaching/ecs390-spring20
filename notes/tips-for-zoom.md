## General Tips

This section is for using Zoom in general.

### Patience

> *Ask students to be patient during this transition period.*

It's definitely going to be hard for them to figure out how to learn online with the little notice they were given.
If that's the case, imagine how difficult it is for us as instructors to completely reconfigure our classes to be taught online with that little notice!

### License and Downloading

> *[ucdaviscoe.zoom.us](ucdaviscoe.zoom.us) is UC Davis College of Engineering's (CoE) Zoom portal.*

The Department of Computer Science is inside CoE, so you should use this one, assuming you have a TA position inside CS.
If you're working with a different department, then the link that you'll use will probably be different.

> *Verify that you have a Zoom Pro license.*

Some of the features we will talk about require a Zoom Pro license.
If you have a TA position with CS this quarter, you should have already been given a Zoom Pro license.
You can verify by logging into the Zoom website and checking the Profile page.
If not, you'll need to ask your instructor to contact CoE to add the license to your account.

> *Download Zoom, even if you're not hosting meetings.*

Once you have the license issues resolved, you'll need to download Zoom if you want to host meetings.
It's not necessary to download it if you're only going to be attending meetings, but I'd still recommend doing so anyway.

### Meeting Setup

> *Make meetings visible for your students by setting up the meetings through the Zoom tab on Canvas.*

Your instructor will need to enable the tab and integration, so ask them to do so if it isn't enabled already.
Once you're on the tab, your instructor can set up a "recurring meeting" for your discussions or office hours.
Your discussions and office hours will probably be at the same time every week, so this takes care of constantly making new meetings.
One-off meetings, such as one-time office hours, can be scheduled in the same way.

Note that I believe you'll need to ask the instructor to set up the meetings for you.
I don't think that the TA role on Canvas allows you to make meetings on the Zoom tab, but I may be wrong.

### Zoombombing and Security

> *Anyone with the link to the meeting can join, unless you set a password.*

This can enable [Zoombombers](https://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/a-tale-of-two-zoom-meetings-glitches-and-porn/).
Here are a variety of resources that contain steps to prevent Zoombombing:

* [this post on the UC Santa Cruz subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/ftwn1h)

### Meeting Settings

> *Enable the ability to mute everyone upon entering the call.*

This is done in the meeting settings in Canvas.
It's never a bad idea to do so; students can always unmute themselves if you allow them to.
Additionaly, as the host, you have the option to:

* mute all (helpful if someone's being disruptive)
* prevent students from unmuting themselves (helpful if you're lecturing)

The options above are in the Participants window inside the Zoom meeting.

> *Disable the ability to allow students to join before you do.*

This is done in the meeting settings in Canvas.
It can be helpful, but I think that this is a bad idea for the following reasons:

* it can enable Zoombombing
* students can unmute themselves if the host isn't inside
* if you leave the meeting and don't end it for everyone, one of the students who joined before you becomes the host

If this option is disabled, when students try to join a meeting when the host isn't inside, they get a notification telling them that they're waiting for the meeting to start, so there's no confusion there.

 > *Enable the option to add co-hosts in settings.*

This is done in the settings on the Zoom website.
If another TA or instructor joins your call, you can make them a co-host.
Being a co-host allows them to do some things on the management side of the Zoom call.

> *Enable the option to allow breakout rooms.*

This is done in the settings on the Zoom website.
You want these for two reasons:

* breaking students into smaller groups during discussions
* meeting with students individually during office hours while still allowing the main meeting to go on as normal

I'll talk more about each of these uses in the relevant sections below.

> *Enable the option to allow only the host to share their screen.*

This is done in the settings on the Zoom website.
This means only you as the host can screen share.
This is done to prevent Zoombombing.
It also ensures that students don't share their code or answers to everybody inside the meeting.

Note that this option (and the option to prevent students from unmuting themselves) gets overridden inside breakout rooms.
Don't worry about meeting students individually and them not being able to share their screen or talk.

### Screen Sharing

> *A webcam is optional and not truly necessary.*

Your face will be put to side when sharing your screen.
Students can also control if and where they see your cameras, so don't worry about that.

> *Click on the "Share Screen" button to select a window to share.*

This is done in the meeting controls during a Zoom call.
If you've moved your meeting controls, it might be elsewhere, but it's generally at the bottom.
This allows you to present off things like PowerPoint presentations or a Firefox tab as I'm doing.
When sharing, hit "New Share" at the bottom to change windows/screens.

It may also be useful to enable the annotate screen option in the settings on the Zoom website.
Doing so allows you to draw on your PowerPoint or other presentation.
The "Annotate" button during a Zoom call is close to the "Share Screen" button in the meeting controls.
Note that if you do this, you'll probably want to disallow participants to make annotations.
The option is close.

> *What if I want to write on something like a whiteboard?*

You have a few options for scribing.
For all of these, you're going to want a tablet with a stylus.
Attempting to scribe with a mouse and keyboard is very difficult.
If you don't have a tablet with a stylus, then I would recommend using a PowerPoint or presentation aid.

If you have an iPhone or iPad (preferably with a stylus) then Zoom's AirPlay integration is best. It's in the options when selecting a new screen to share.
You can also scribe on other applications, such as Endnote or Microsoft OneNote.
Zoom also has a whiteboard option, but this must be enabled in the web settings.

### Chat

> *Do you want to use chat, and if so, how do you want to use it?*

Just depends, be consistent about it.

Some instructors use it to get answers from students, but there is the participation markers (similar to the Raise Hand feature) and polls (which you need to enable in settings) that can also be used for that feature.

Some instructors use it to ask for questions from students, but the Raise Hand feature is better about notifying the host that there's a question compared to attempting to constantly look at chat.
Especially true if you're using an iPad or other table to scribe, since you can't see chat on there.

Also prevent chat from becoming Twitch chat if you do decide to use the chat.
This is a professional environment.
You may need to remind students (or threaten to stop using the chat) if they behave inappropriately.
Chat can get recorded much like the actual lecture so they should mind what they say.

Remember you can also kick individual users if they're behaving inappropriately.

### Finishing a Meeting

> *Make sure to end the meeting for everyone once you leave, unless a co-instructor is present.*

If you enabled the ability for students to join before you, one of them becomes the host, which is very bad.
You'll also want to make sure that, if you're recording, the recording gets ended.
Ending the meeting for everyone will do that.

## Discussions

This section is specifically for when you're leading a discussion.

### Audio During Discussions

Make sure they can't unmute themselves in settings so that they don't interrupt you while you're leading the discussion.

Other option is to allow students to unmute themselves and have them be honest about it, but wouldn't recommend this.
Remember that **you as the host can always mute all.**

### Recording Discussions

Option to record automatically to cloud which syncs to Canvas.
This option can be enabled in the meeting setup.
Recordings are great for students who can't make it at the scheduled discussion time.

Let students know lectures and discussions are being recorded inside the syllabus and at the beginning of each class session.
CA is a two-party consent which means that you need to inform everybody when they're being recorded.
FERPA protects recordings of students and you don't want to mess with that.

### Answering Student Questions During Discussion

Have student raise hands for them to ask a question.
Raise hand button is in the participant box, same place you'd look to see if somebody is raising their hand.

Person who raise hand moves up in participant list, first come first serve.
When they raise hand, unmute them.
Notification pops up asking them to unmute so it doesn't come by surprise.

Once you've finished answering their questions, mute them again.
You can't guarantee student mute themselves, but most are generally good about it.

## Office Hours

This section is specifically for when you're leading office hours.

### Audio During Office Hours

Up to you if you want students to have the ability so they **can** unmute themselves in the settings.
Office hours should be less structured and more self-regulating than a discussion.
Students are generally good about respecting boundaries here.
You can always change this later in case it becomes a problem.
It's up to you, though.

### Recording Office Hours

I **wouldn't** enable option to record automatically to cloud for office hours.
Especially since personal stuff will probably be discussed or student answers shared.
It's not a good idea.

### Answering Student Questions In A Group

People can unmute themselves to talk, or they can raise hand to be unmuted.
Just depends on what you selected earlier.
Good for just answering questions normally that aren't private.

You can enable the option to mute/hold/kick students who are being disruptive.

### Answering Student Questions Privately

I mentioned earlier that you'll want to enable breakout rooms; this is why.
Make sure to enable breakout rooms in the settings beforehand.
You need to be the main host (not co-host) to use breakout rooms.

Have Zoom automatically make a bunch of breakout rooms, say 10 or so.
Make sure to assign students manually, not automatically, when doing so.
Otherwise you'll assign everyone out of the main session, which you don't want.

Sharing solutions or other private information with a single student?
Time to use those breakout rooms.
Manually assign a student you want to talk to individually to a breakout room.
Also assign yourself to the breakout room.
Breakout room overrides the typical settings on sharing screens and muting, so they should be able to share and talk immediately.

Main session will continue to go on while you're in the breakout room.
You can leave to main session once student is done.
You may want another TA (basically, hold joint office hours) so that somebody else is in the room while you discuss privately with another student.
Otherwise students will be confused as to why there's no TA inside the Zoom call!

Waiting list is another option if you want to answer everything privately.
Throughput on the waiting list is much lower, though.
