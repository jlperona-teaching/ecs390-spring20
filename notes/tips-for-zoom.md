## Before You Get Started

This section covers things you should do and familiarize yourself with before making your first Zoom call.

### Patience

> *Ask students to be patient during this transition period.*

It's definitely going to be hard for them to figure out how to learn online with the little notice they were given.
If that's the case, imagine how difficult it is for us as instructors to completely reconfigure our classes to be taught online with that little notice!

### License and Downloading

> *[ucdaviscoe.zoom.us](ucdaviscoe.zoom.us) is UC Davis College of Engineering's (CoE) Zoom portal.*

The Department of Computer Science (CS) is inside CoE, so you should use this one, assuming you have a TA position inside CS.
If you're working with a different department, then the link that you'll use may be different.

> *Verify that you have a Zoom Pro license.*

Some of the features we will talk about require a Zoom Pro license.
If you have a TA position with CS this quarter, you should have already been given a Zoom Pro license.
You can verify by logging into the Zoom website and checking the Profile page.
If not, you'll need to ask your instructor to contact CoE to add the license to your account.

> *Download Zoom, even if you're not hosting meetings.*

Once you have the license issues resolved, you'll need to download Zoom if you want to host meetings.
It's not necessary to download it if you're only going to be attending meetings, but I'd still recommend doing so anyway.

### Setting Up Meetings

> *Make meetings visible for your students by setting up the meetings through the Zoom tab on Canvas.*

Your instructor will need to enable the Zoom tab and integration, so ask them to do so if it isn't enabled already.
Once you're on the tab, your instructor can set up a "recurring meeting" for your discussions or office hours.
Your discussions and office hours will probably be at the same time every week, so this takes care of constantly making new meetings.
One-off meetings, such as one-time office hours, can be scheduled in the same way.

Note that I believe you'll need to ask the instructor to set up the meetings for you.
I don't think that the TA role on Canvas allows you to make meetings on the Zoom tab, but I may be wrong.

### Meeting Settings

> *Enable the ability to mute everyone upon entering the call.*

This is done in the meeting settings in Canvas.
It's never a bad idea to do so; students can always unmute themselves if you allow them to.
Additionaly, as the host, you have the option to:

* mute all (helpful if someone's being disruptive)
* prevent students from unmuting themselves (helpful if you're lecturing)

The options above are in the Participants window inside the Zoom meeting.

> *Disable the ability to allow students to join before you do.*

This is done in the meeting settings in Canvas.
It can be helpful, but I think that this is a bad idea for the following reasons:

* it can enable Zoombombing
* students can unmute themselves if the host isn't inside
* if you leave the meeting and don't end it for everyone, one of the students who joined before you becomes the host

If this option is disabled, when students try to join a meeting when the host isn't inside, they get a notification telling them that they're waiting for the meeting to start, so there's no confusion there.

 > *Enable the option to add co-hosts in settings.*

This is done in the settings on the Zoom website.
If another TA or instructor joins your call, you can make them a co-host.
Being a co-host allows them to do some things on the management side of the Zoom call.

> *Enable the option to allow breakout rooms.*

This is done in the settings on the Zoom website.
You want these for two reasons:

* breaking students into smaller groups during discussions
* meeting with students individually during office hours while still allowing the main meeting to go on as normal

I'll talk more about each of these uses in the relevant sections below for [discussions](#breakout-groups) and [office hours](#answering-student-questions-privately).

> *Enable the option to allow only the host to share their screen.*

This is done in the settings on the Zoom website.
This means only you as the host can screen share.
This is done to prevent Zoombombing.
It also ensures that students don't share their code or answers to everybody inside the meeting.

Note that this option (and the option to prevent students from unmuting themselves) gets overridden inside breakout rooms.
Don't worry about meeting students individually and them not being able to share their screen or talk.

### Zoombombing and Security

> *Anyone with the link to a meeting can join, unless you set a password.*

[Zoombombers](https://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/a-tale-of-two-zoom-meetings-glitches-and-porn/) have become more frequent now that using Zoom has become a bigger thing.
Here are a variety of resources that contain steps to prevent Zoombombing that explain it far better than I can:

* [this page from the UC Davis Department of Psychology](https://sites.google.com/ucdavis.edu/ucdavis-psychology-plan-s2020/zoom-bombing-other-mischief)
* [this page from UC Davis IET](http://kb.ucdavis.edu/?id=2466)
* [this post on the UC Santa Cruz subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/ftwn1h)

Prevention is better than handling it during the meeting.
That said, you should know how to kick participants who are being disruptive.
You can kick individual participants in the Participants window by hovering over the participant, clicking on "More...", and selecting the option to remove them from the meeting.

## Inside the Call

This section covers topics that you'll need to be concerned with once you're inside a Zoom call.

### Webcams and Screen Sharing

> *A webcam is optional and not truly necessary.*

This is done in the meeting settings in Canvas.
You can enable or disable the ability for the host or participants to show their webcam, or video in Zoom parlance.
It might be useful to prevent participants from showing video to prevent Zoombombing, but it's very easy to tell who's being disruptive via video, so I don't see it as a big problem.

If you have a webcam, your face will be put to side when sharing your screen.
Students can also control if and where they see your cameras, so don't worry about that.

> *Click on the "Share Screen" button to select a window to share.*

This is done in the meeting controls during a Zoom call.
If you've moved your meeting controls, it might be elsewhere, but it's generally at the bottom.
This allows you to present off windows like a PowerPoint presentation, or a whole screen if you want to display multiple things.
When sharing, hit "New Share" at the bottom to change windows or screens.

> *Consider enabling the option to allow annotations on shared screens.*

This is done in the settings on the Zoom website.
It may be useful to enable the annotate screen option to allow you to draw on your PowerPoint or other presentation.
The "Annotate" button during a Zoom call is close to the "Share Screen" button in the meeting controls.

Note that if you do this, you'll probably want to disallow participants to make annotations to prevent them from being disruptive.
The option to do so is close to the other two options.
That ability to be disruptive may be a reason why you *wouldn't* want to consider enabling the annotation option.

> *What if I want to write on something like a whiteboard?*

You have a few options for scribing.
For all of these, you're going to want a tablet with a stylus.
Attempting to scribe with a mouse and keyboard is very difficult.
If you don't have a tablet with a stylus, then I would recommend using a PowerPoint or other presentation aid over scribing.

If you have an iPhone or iPad (preferably with a stylus) then Zoom's AirPlay integration is best. It's in the options when selecting a new screen to share.
You can also scribe on other applications, such as Endnote or Microsoft OneNote.
Zoom also has a whiteboard option, but this must be enabled in the web settings.

### Chat

> *Do you want to use chat, and if so, how do you want to use it?*

Using chat is tricky, mostly because I feel that it causes problems that you may not want to deal with.
It's up to you to decide if it's worth using.
There's other ways you can use chat, but the two I've listed below are the main two I've seen in terms of instructors using it as part of their teaching.

Some instructors use chat to get answers from students when they ask a question.
However, there are the participation markers in the Participants window that let you get answers to simple yes/no questions.
The Polls feature (which you need to enable in the settings on the Zoom website) allow you to ask multiple-choice questions, and that may be useful as well.
Finally, you can use the Raise Hand feature, which is right next to the participation markers, to call on an individual student if they have an answer.

Some instructors use chat to ask for questions from students after they're done with a topic.
That said, the Raise Hand feature is better about notifying the host that there's a question compared to attempting to constantly look at chat.
This is especially true if you're using an iPad to scribe, since you can't see chat on there.

> *Keep chat professional if you do decide to use it.*

Don't let chat become Twitch chat if you do decide to use it.
This is a professional environment, and your students should act like it.
You may need to remind students (or threaten to stop using the chat) if they behave inappropriately.
Chat can get recorded in a similar manner to regular recordings, so they should mind what they say while using it.

Remember that you can also kick individual users if they're behaving inappropriately.

### Finishing a Meeting

> *Make sure to end the meeting for everyone once you leave, unless a co-instructor is present.*

If you enabled the ability for students to join before you, one of them becomes the host, which is very bad.
You'll also want to make sure that, if you're recording, the recording gets ended.
Ending the meeting for everyone will do that.

## Discussions

This section is specifically for when you're leading a discussion.

### Audio During Discussions

> *Disable the ability to allow students to unmute themselves.*

This is done in the Particpants tab during a Zoom call.
Students should have been muted to start with, assuming you [followed my recommendation earlier](#meeting-settings).
This ensures students can't unmute themselves and don't interrupt you while you're leading the discussion.

The other option would be to allow students to unmute themselves.
This requires your students to be self-regulating and honest about unmuting themselves, so I wouldn't recommend this.
If you do so, remember that you as the host can always mute all.
The options to do so is in the Participants window inside the Zoom meeting.

### Recording Discussions

>  *Do you want your discussions to be recorded?*

This is done in the meeting settings in Canvas.
Recordings can automatically be uploaded to the cloud, which syncs to Canvas.
These recordings are great for students who can't make it to the scheduled discussion time.
Generally, you won't have a choice in this, and your instructor will decide whether discussions are going to be recorded.

> *Make sure to let students know they're being recorded.*

Your instructor should let students know that discussions are being recorded inside the syllabus.
[Campus counsel has advised instructors](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/teach/planning-remote-instruction) to inform students so that they know they're being recorded at the beginning of each class session; "instructors includes you as a discussion leader.
This may be due to the fact that California is a [two-party recording consent state](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=637.).
Also note that the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act) protects recordings of students as well.
Play it safe and let students know that they're being recorded every time you begin your discussion section.

### Discussion Breakout Groups

> *Make sure to have enabled breakout rooms.*

I mentioned earlier that you'll want to enable breakout rooms; this is one of the reasons why.
Make sure to enable breakout rooms in the web settings beforehand.
You need to be the main host, and not a co-host, in order to use breakout rooms.

> *Have students work together to solve a worksheet or other problem.*

This is done in the meeting controls during a Zoom call.
This is useful if you want to emulate the ability from an in-person discussion section to ask students to group together.
Once students are worked together, they can work together on a worksheet or other problem.

When you click on the "Breakout Rooms" button, tell Zoom to make a bunch of breakout rooms, depending on how many students you want per breakout room.
Make sure to assign students automatically when doing so.
Students will be grouped randomly if you pick "automatically," which requires the least amount of work on your part.

Once you're done allowing students to work together, there will be a button to close the breakout rooms and move everyone back into the main room.
Use this feature once the amount of time you've allotted students to work together is up.

### Answering Student Questions During Discussion

> *Have students raise their hand (virtually) for them to ask a question.*

The "Raise Hand" button is in the Participant tab.
This is the same place you'd look to see if somebody is raising their hand.

A student who raises their hand moves to the top of the participant list on your screen.
This is first come, first serve.
When you are ready to answer questions, unmute the student at the top who has their hand raised.
A notification will pop up, asking them to unmute their microphone, so it doesn't come by surprise.

Once you've finished answering a student's questions, make sure to mute them again.
You can't guarantee that a student will appropriately mute themselves.
Generally, I've seen that students are good about it, but in case a student doesn't, you'll want to do so yourself.
They won't be able to unmute themselves again afterwards, assuming you've [set the appropriate option](#meeting-settings).

## Office Hours

This section is specifically for when you're leading office hours.

### Audio During Office Hours

> *Do you want students to be able to unmute themselves?*

This is done in the Participants window inside the Zoom meeting.
It's up to you if you want students to have the ability to unmute themselves.
Note that you should keep them muted upon entering the call, though.

Office hours should be less structured and more self-regulating than a discussion.
Students are generally good about respecting boundaries.
Plus, you can always change this later in case it becomes a problem.

Personally, I would treat office hours like a discussion and keep students muted unless they raise their hand.
I think that it's less susceptible to abuse that way.
It's up to you, though.

### Recording Office Hours

> *Don't record office hours.*

This is done in the meeting settings in Canvas.
I wouldn't enable the option to record automatically to cloud for office hours.
It's pretty likely that personal and sensitive topics will probably be discussed.
Another issue that students may share their answers to questions, which you definitely wouldn't want recorded.
It's not a good idea to record office hours at all.

Note that you can't control if students make their own recordings of office hours.
That said, if they distribute any of those recordings, those can be considered academic misconduct and reported to the [UC Davis Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs](https://ossja.ucdavis.edu/).
It's one thing to make a recording for their own use; it's another to *distribute those recordings they shouldn't have made in the first place.*

### Answering Student Questions In A Group

> *The exact mechanism depends on if students can unmute themselves.*

Depending on your selection in the [Audio During Office Hours](#audio-during-office-hours) section, students can either unmute themselves to talk, or they can raise their hand to be unmuted.
Answering questions in this fashion (where everyone can hear everyone else) is good for answering general questions that don't need to be private.

Remember, you can always kick students from the meeting who are being disruptive.

### Answering Student Questions Privately

> *Make sure to have enabled breakout rooms.*

I mentioned earlier that you'll want to enable breakout rooms; answering student questions privately is the other reason why.
Make sure to enable breakout rooms in the web settings beforehand.
You need to be the main host, and not a co-host, in order to use breakout rooms.

> *Breakout rooms are the best mechanism to talk to a student privately.*

This is done in the meeting controls during a Zoom call.
When you click on the "Breakout Rooms" button, tell Zoom to make a bunch of breakout rooms, say 10 or so.
Make sure to assign students manually, not automatically, when doing so.
Otherwise you'll assign everyone out of the main session and into a bunch of smaller sessions, which you don't want to do.

What happens when a student wants to share solutions or other private information?
Time to use those breakout rooms.
Manually assign the student that you want to talk to individually to a breakout room.
Once you have done so, assign yourself to the breakout room as well.
Other students won't be able to join you, since you as the host control the breakout rooms.
Also note that being in a breakout room overrides the typical settings on sharing screens and muting, so they should be able to share their screen and talk to you immediately.

The main session with the rest of the students will continue to go on while you're in the breakout room.
You can return to the main session once you're done with the student.
Because of this, you may want another TA or instructor inside the Zoom call, which would mean that you'd be holding joint office hours.
This is so that somebody else is in the main room while you're inside the breakout room with another student.
Otherwise, students may be confused as to why there's no TA inside the Zoom call!

> *The waiting room is another option for talking to students individually.*

This is done either in the settings on the Zoom website, or in the meeting settings in Canvas.
If you enable the waiting room option on the Zoom website, it applies to all your meetings.
If you want to have it apply to a specific meeting, then enable it inside the meeting settings in Canvas.

The waiting room is another option if you want to answer everything privately.
You can allow students in, one by one, to talk to you and you alone.
Everyone else will receive a notification that they're inside the waiting room and that they're waiting for you to admit them.

Note that the throughput on the waiting room mechanism is much lower than with the breakout rooms method.
You'll only be interacting with one student at a time with the waiting rooms.
If you feel that office hours mostly consists of students trying to ask you these types of questions, this option may be a viable alternative to the breakout rooms.

## More Resources for Remote Instruction

This section contains additional resources for remote instruction.
I've been compiling this list from the vast amount of discussion that's been going on ever since universities started reacting to the current crisis.

If you know of any other resources that you believe would be useful, please let me know and I'd be happy to add it to the list.

### UC Davis Department of Psychology

> *The UC Davis Department of Psychology has been standing out given the current situtaion.*

In terms of preparing their instructional staff for remote instruction, the UC Davis Department of Psychology has been excelling, hence why it's first on the list of the resources.
Their [plan for instructional continuity](https://sites.google.com/ucdavis.edu/ucdavis-psychology-plan-s2020/home) for Spring Quarter 2020 has been shared widely throughout the academic community here at UC Davis for its quality.
You'll definitely want to have a look at this if you're teaching this quarter.

In particular, you're going to want to look at their [shared materials](https://sites.google.com/ucdavis.edu/ucdavis-psychology-plan-s2020/shared-materials).
As I mentioned earlier, their [slides from the training meeting for their TAs](https://www.dropbox.com/s/miejilg32ooa0k9/Zoom%20Training%20Meeting%20for%20Psych%20TAs.pdf?dl=0) is probably the best place to get started or learn more about using Zoom.

### Keep Teaching

> *UC Davis has created their own webpage for instructors to [Keep Teaching](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/).*

This is focused upon "instructional resilience" and is meant more towards faculty, but there could be some helpful information on there for you to look over.
You'll probably want to look at the [*Teach*](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/teach) page in particular, since that's what you'll be doing.

> *Many other universities are doing the same thing.*

There's no sense reinventing the wheel.
Many other universities are putting together their own pages for their instructional staff to keep teaching.
Check out [this crowdsourced Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VT9oiNYPyiEsGHBoDKlwLlWAsWP58sGV7A3oIuEUG3k) that contains links to other universities' pages on continuing to teach during this time.

> *STEM education centers are also a worthwhile resource.*

You may also want to check out this list of [*Resources for STEM Education Centers in Response to COVID-19*](https://serc.carleton.edu/StemEdCenters/news/236312.html) by the [*Network of STEM Education Centers*](https://serc.carleton.edu/StemEdCenters/index.html) at Carleton College.
Specifically, the "disciplinary resources on teaching remotely" may be helpful for best practices on remote instruction.

### Keep Learning

> *There's also resources specifically directed at students to [Keep Learning](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/student-resources).*

You can forward the page linked above to the students in the class you're TAing for so that they can get help with any issues they're encountering.
It addresses a wide variety of topics, from lacking a suitable computer to some more complicated situations.

Also, if you're reading this, you're presumably a student.
This may be worthwhile to read for the classes you're taking yourself.
